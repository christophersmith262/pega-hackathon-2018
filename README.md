## Configuring
This example uses a dataset from the Cambridgeside Galleria. To rebuild the
application for other floor plans, we need to edit the `./src/config.js`.

## Building
```
npm install
./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
```

## Running
Just serve the index.html and navigate to it in a web browser.
